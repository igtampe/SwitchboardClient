# SwitchboardClient

A Demonstration of the SwitchboardClient Class through a small program called the Switchboard Console. It lets you connect to a Switchboard server, and execute commands on it.

Not mentioned in the help is the option to read the stream if there is any data by using the command `READ`.
Also, if the server connection ever hangs, you can break out of a read attempt by using the <kbd>Esc</kbd> key.
